# The Data Science Incubator

<img src="demo.jpg" style="width:300px; height:auto; float:right; margin-left:15px">

Increasingly, science is a data-driven endeavor.  The goal of the Data Science
Incubator is to bring together data scientists with domain scientists to
advance the state of the art in science.  We leverage state 
of the art tools like [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org),
[GraphLab](http://graphlab.org), and [Myria](http://myria-web.appspot.com) to
help researchers make sense of scientific data.

The Data Science Incubator works on the principle of direct collaboration.
During the lifetime of the project, researchers will directly engage with our
team of data scientists, either in our office (currently, Sieg 326) or at
another location.  We have found this style of \"hands-on-keyboards\"
collaboration to be invaluable, as it facillitates rapid knowledge transfer
between domain scientists and data scientists.

## Issues We Can Help With

The members of the Data Science Incubator draw on a large body of expertise in
databases, machine learning, visualization, and other fields.  We specialize in
the following types of challanges:

* **Managing data at scale**: Many data analysis techniques do not scale to large
  datasets.  For example, simple Python and R scripts exhibit poor performance
  when data set sizes exceed main memory.  We have deep experience working with
  scalable data platforms such as Map/Reduce, parallel databases such as Myria,
  and graph-processing platforms such as GraphLab.

* **Automating data management tasks**: Scientists spend too much time
  \"futzing\"  with data: converting between file formats, cleaning data,
  down-sampling, etc.  Through systems like
  [SqlShare](https://sqlshare.escience.washington.edu), we aim to  simplify
  these data manipulation tasks so scientists can focus on the task of doing
  science. 

* **Visualization**: We have experience building data-driven visualizations to
    help scientists make sense of data.  We focus on web-enabled visualizations
    using platforms like [D3](http://d3js.org).


## Principles

Web-accessible resources (sqlshare, myria)

Because science is a
collaborative process, we place an emphasis on making all of our work available
on the web.


Our team has a strong track record of building systems that get real use.  See
[this page](http://escience.washington.edu/what-we-do/projects) for a
description of our success stories.

## How to Get Started

Do you have interesting data challenges?  A good first step is to setup an
initial consultation by [contacting us](mailto:info@escience.washington.edu).
Include the phrase \"incubator\" in the subject line.

After an initial meeting, you can submit a short proposal to the [eScience
institute](mailto:info@escience.washington.edu). A proposal should contain the
following information:

* Contact information.

* Project summary / objective.

* A description of your data: data size, formats, where the data currently
  resides, etc.
 
* The challenges you face; in other words, what do you need help with?

* The timeframe for your work.

* A list of people who will be directly collaborating with us.

A sample proposal is available [here](sample.html).

The proposal undergoes a review process from the [eScience steering
committee](http://escience.washington.edu/who-we-are/steering-committee).  The
ideal proposal has both scientic merit and technical (data science) merit.

Note that seed grants are available for short-term projects.  Contact us for
more details.
