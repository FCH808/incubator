# The Data Science Incubator

Increasingly, science is a data-driven endeavor.  Scientists have access to
phenomenal amounts of data, but they often lack the requisite skills to make
sense of data at scale.  Data scientists understand the \"lay of the land\" of
big data analytics, including techniques for querying, visualizing, storing,
sharing, and data mining.  However, data scientists lack insight into 
scientific problem domains.

The goal of the Data Science Incubator is to bring together data scientists with 
domain scientists to advance the state of the art in science.  We leverage state
of the art tools like [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org),
[GraphLab](http://graphlab.org), and [Myria](http://myria-web.appspot.com) to
help researchers make sense of data at scale.  Because science is a
collaborative process, we place an emphasis on making all of our work available
on the web.

The Data Science Incubator works on the premise of direct collaboration.  During
the lifetime of the project, researchers will directly engage with our team of
data scientists, either in our office (currently, Sieg 326) or at another
location.  We have found direct collaboration to be invaluable, as it
facillitates rapid knowledge transfer between domain scientists and data
scientists.

Note that seed grants are available for short-term projects.  Contact us for
more details.
